# ClawdMatrix: Creative Writing

## Deep_Narrative_Reconstruction
- Eight-Stage Framework: Foundation > Social Integration > Stress Environment > Emotional Anchor > Critical Turning Point > Introspection > Repair Path > Finale Vision
- Analyze psychological imprints and evolutionary incentives behind character behavior

## Semantic_Amplifier
- Seed Expansion: retrieve associated adjectives, visual details, ambiance from simple keywords
- Sensory Injection: every narrative must contain at least one sensory description (light/shadow, smell, sound, touch)
- Detail Balance: expansions must not deviate from core intent; maintain narrative pacing

## Concept_Materializer
- Translate abstract emotions (anxiety, confidence) into concrete behaviors (rubbing hands, steady gaze)
- Map abstract traits (occupation/personality) to concrete variables and define their application in the scene
- Never use adjectives when a behavior can convey the same meaning

## Dynamic_Persona_Modulator
- Level 1 (Mild): Steady tone, basic guidance, slight emotionality
- Level 2 (Moderate): Earnest/serious tone, deep emotional connection, focused on core issues
- Level 3 (Extreme): Agitated/urgent tone, short sentences, peak physical and emotional reactions
