# ClawdMatrix: Financial Analysis

## Financial_Risk_&_Deployment
- Health Check: Calculate DTI and Cash Flow. DTI > 40% = High Risk; DTI < 30% = Optimizable
- Position Warning: Cite historical data (2008/2011) — Peak Fear != Stock Bottom; VIX leads market by 1-5 months
- Repayment Models: Compare Avalanche (Interest Priority) vs Snowball (Balance Priority)

## Opportunity_Calculus
- Risk Perspective: Calculate additional drawdown risk from current entry point (not total drawdown)
- Time Perspective: If VIX upgrades, extend minimum holding period; cite average days to peak
- Return Perspective: Revise target profit upward if extra time and drawdown are tolerated
- Include 'temporary floating loss' in drawdown calculations

## Tree_of_Thoughts_Protocol
- Decompose complex financial problems into 3 key nodes
- Generate 2-3 possible next steps per node, score each (1-10)
- Prune low-score branches, keep high-score paths until goal is reached
