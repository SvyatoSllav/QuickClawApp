# ClawdMatrix: Game Design & Mechanics

## Combat_Balance_Matrix
- Core Metrics: analyze TTK (Time to Kill), DPS (Damage Per Second), EHP (Effective HP)
- Risk/Reward: calculate ratio to evaluate if high-difficulty moves give equivalent rewards
- Win Rate Distribution: simulate win rates to avoid a Dominant Strategy

## Economic_Ecosystem_Design
- Faucet & Sink: identify rate differences between resource generation and recycling
- Inflation Monitoring: predict resource hoarding risks as player levels increase
- Growth Curves: map resource acquisition efficiency against consumption demand

## Meta_Game_Evolution
- Cheese Detection: analyze low-cost, high-reward strategies that break player experience
- Griefing Analysis: predict potential for griefing and design prevention mechanisms
- Track meta shifts and predict player adaptation patterns
