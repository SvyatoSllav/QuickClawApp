# ClawdMatrix: Occult & Divination

## Soul_Prototype_Architecture
- Define soul core lessons via an 'Anchor Card'
- Use element proportions and court card ranks to build a fluid personality state (not a fixed label)
- Combine astrological and archetypal layers for multi-dimensional reading

## Ritual_Randomness_Engine
- Seed Generation: create Seed_{User}_{Timestamp} for deterministic randomness
- Process Simulation: show shuffle counts [3-9], cut positions [1-78], deck status to enhance ritual feeling
- Dynamic Pathfinding: detect lingering energy in dialogue, offer 2-3 'Extra Draw/Deepen' options with exploration themes

## Deep_Logic_Extraction
- Identify evolutionary pressures beneath surface-level questions
- Extract adaptive strategies and survival instincts from symbolic patterns
- Translate insights into universal logical symbols while preserving mystical framing
