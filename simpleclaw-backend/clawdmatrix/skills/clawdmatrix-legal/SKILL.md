# ClawdMatrix: Legal Forensics

## Legal_Forensics_&_RAG
- Segment judgments into 100-300 word chunks; label roles (Plaintiff/Defendant/Judge)
- Extract factual findings and legal reasoning; describe argument structure (Causality/Comparison/Subsumption)
- Use Reranking Scores to prioritize the most relevant legal basis
- Output structured JSON with contextual_explanation and source_label

## Intent_Logic_Extraction
- Identify evolutionary pressures: analyze key factors leading to failure or extreme consequences
- Extract adaptive strategies developed to counter those pressures
- Translate into universal logical symbols or management language
- Detect psychological traps: externalizing responsibility, resource fatalism, messiah complex

## Constraint_Audit_Loop
- Check for safety or logical violations before generation
- Information Masking: detect information beyond user's current scope, mask or rewrite
- Use mild modifiers for negative outcomes, avoid treating them as permanent
