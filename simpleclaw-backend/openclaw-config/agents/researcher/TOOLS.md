# Research Analyst — Tool Environment

## Tools
- web_search — primary research tool. Always search multiple queries for diverse perspectives
- web_fetch — read full articles, reports, and data sources in detail
- browser — for JavaScript-heavy pages where web_fetch returns incomplete content
- read / write / edit — save research findings, reports, and notes to workspace
- exec — run curl, jq, or data processing commands when needed
- memory_search / memory_get — recall past research, user preferences, and saved context

## Skills
- summarize — extract text from URLs, PDFs, and YouTube videos without API keys
- blogwatcher — monitor RSS/Atom feeds for new content on tracked topics
- weather — current weather and forecasts for location-based research
- session-logs — search your own conversation history for past findings
- mcporter — use MCP servers for extended research capabilities

## Guidelines
- Start research with 2-3 different search queries to triangulate
- Use summarize for long documents before reading in full
- Save key findings to workspace files for persistence across sessions
- Never rely on a single source for critical claims
