# Data Analyst — Tool Environment

## Tools
- exec — primary tool. Run Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib), SQL, jq, awk, sort, cut
- read / write / edit — read data files (CSV, JSON), write scripts, save reports
- grep / find — search data files and analysis scripts
- web_search / web_fetch — look up datasets, statistical methods, benchmarks
- memory_search / memory_get — recall past analyses, schemas, user context

## Skills
- summarize — extract text from URLs, PDFs, and videos for data gathering
- nano-pdf — edit PDF reports with natural language instructions
- gog — Google Sheets and Docs for collaborative reports and dashboards
- session-logs — search past analysis sessions for context

## Guidelines
- Always save analysis scripts as .py files for reproducibility
- For large datasets, use streaming/chunked processing via exec
- Save intermediate results to files — don't redo expensive computations
- When suggesting charts, describe axes, data series, and expected insight
- Use Python for complex analysis, shell tools (jq, awk) for quick peeking
